# Developing for Accessibility

This repository covers the content for the Developing for Accessibility academy session.

This app is built on top of [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev) and [Reactstrap](http://reactstrap.github.io/)

## üèÖ #Goals/Learning Outcomes

- Learn guiding principles for developing for accessiblity
  - Use accessible HTML
  - Use a pattern/component library so it's easy to be consistently accessible
  - Use automated tools to test the accessibility of your app
  - Manually audit your site because automated tools can't catch everything üòÖ
- Learn how to use automated tools for developing accessible apps
  - Static code analysis
  - Automated tests
  - Browser extensions
- Learn to fix common accessibility mistakes

## üöÄ Starting the project

The `fixme` branch has a bunch of accessibility violations to fix.

```
git checkout fixme
```

### Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### Start the app

```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### Run the linter

```
npm run lint
```

### Run tests

This project uses [axe-core](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) to automate accessibility testing.

```
npm test
```

- [Link](http://w3c.github.io/aria-practices/#link) - great for navigating to another page or to a section of the current page. Links != buttons
